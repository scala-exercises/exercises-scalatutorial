  /**
   * = Naming Things =
   *
   * Consider the following program that computes the area of a disc
   * whose radius is `10`:
   *
   * {{{
   *   3.14159 * 10 * 10
   * }}}
   *
   * To make complex expressions more readable we can give meaningful names to
   * intermediate expressions:
   *
   * {{{
   *   val radius = 10
   *   val pi = 3.14159
   *
   *   pi * radius * radius
   * }}}
   *
   * Besides making the last expression more readable it also allows us to
   * not repeat the actual value of the radius.
   *
   * = Evaluation =
   *
   * A name is evaluated by replacing it with the right hand side of its definition
   *
   * == Example ==
   *
   * Here are the evaluation steps of the above expression:
   *
   * {{{
   *   pi * radius * radius
   *   3.14159 * radius * radius
   *   3.14159 * 10 * radius
   *   31.4159 * radius
   *   31.4159 * 10
   *   314.159
   * }}}
   *
   * = Methods =
   *
   * Definitions can have parameters. For instance:
   */
  def usingSquare(res0: Double): Unit = {
    def square(x: Double) = x * x

    square(3.0) shouldBe res0
  }

  /**
   * Let’s define a method that computes the area of a disc, given its radius:
   */
  def areaExercise(res0: Double): Unit = {
    def square(x: Double) = x * x

    def area(radius: Double): Double = 3.14159 * square(radius)

    area(10) shouldBe res0
  }

  /**
   * = Multiple Parameters =
   *
   * Separate several parameters with commas:
   *
   * {{{
   *   def sumOfSquares(x: Double, y: Double) = square(x) + square(y)
   * }}}
   *
   * = Parameters and Return Types =
   *
   * Function parameters come with their type, which is given after a colon
   *
   * {{{
   *   def power(x: Double, y: Int): Double = ...
   * }}}
   *
   * If a return type is given, it follows the parameter list.
   *
   * = Val vs Def =
   *
   * The right hand side of a `def` definition is evaluated on each use.
   *
   * The right hand side of a `val` definition is evaluated at the point of the definition
   * itself. Afterwards, the name refers to the value.
   *
   * {{{
   *   val x = 2
   *   val y = square(x)
   * }}}
   *
   * For instance, `y` above refers to `4`, not `square(2)`.
   *
   * = Evaluation of Function Applications =
   *
   * Applications of parametrized functions are evaluated in a similar way as
   * operators:
   *
   *  1. Evaluate all function arguments, from left to right
   *  1. Replace the function application by the function's right-hand side, and, at the same time
   *  1. Replace the formal parameters of the function by the actual arguments.
   *
   * == Example ==
   *
   * {{{
   *   sumOfSquares(3, 2+2)
   *   sumOfSquares(3, 4)
   *   square(3) + square(4)
   *   3 * 3 + square(4)
   *   9 + square(4)
   *   9 + 4 * 4
   *   9 + 16
   *   25
   * }}}
   *
   * = The substitution model =
   *
   * This scheme of expression evaluation is called the ''substitution model''.
   *
   * The idea underlying this model is that all evaluation does is ''reduce
   * an expression to a value''.
   *
   * It can be applied to all expressions, as long as they have no side effects.
   *
   * The substitution model is formalized in the λ-calculus, which gives
   * a foundation for functional programming.
   *
   * = Termination =
   *
   * Does every expression reduce to a value (in a finite number of steps)?
   *
   * No. Here is a counter-example:
   *
   * {{{
   *   def loop: Int = loop
   *
   *   loop
   * }}}
   *
   * = Value Definitions and Termination =
   *
   * The difference between `val` and `def` becomes apparent when the right
   * hand side does not terminate. Given
   *
   * {{{
   *   def loop: Int = loop
   * }}}
   *
   * A definition
   *
   * {{{
   *   def x = loop
   * }}}
   *
   * is OK, but a definition
   *
   * {{{
   *   val x = loop
   * }}}
   *
   * will lead to an infinite loop.
   *
   * = Changing the evaluation strategy =
   *
   * The interpreter reduces function arguments to values before rewriting the
   * function application.
   *
   * One could alternatively apply the function to unreduced arguments.
   *
   * For instance:
   *
   * {{{
   *   sumOfSquares(3, 2+2)
   *   square(3) + square(2+2)
   *   3 * 3 + square(2+2)
   *   9 + square(2+2)
   *   9 + (2+2) * (2+2)
   *   9 + 4 * (2+2)
   *   9 + 4 * 4
   *   25
   * }}}
   *
   * = Call-by-name and call-by-value =
   *
   * The first evaluation strategy is known as ''call-by-value'',
   * the second is is known as ''call-by-name''.
   *
   * Both strategies reduce to the same final values
   * as long as
   *
   *  - the reduced expression consists of pure functions, and
   *  - both evaluations terminate.
   *
   * Call-by-value has the advantage that it evaluates every function argument
   * only once.
   *
   * Call-by-name has the advantage that a function argument is not evaluated if the
   * corresponding parameter is unused in the evaluation of the function body.
   *
   * Scala normally uses call-by-value.
   *
   * = Exercise =
   *
   * Complete the following definition of the `triangleArea` function,
   * which takes a triangle base and height as parameters and returns
   * its area:
   */
  def triangleAreaExercise(res0: Double, res1: Double): Unit = {
    def triangleArea(base: Double, height: Double): Double =
      base * height / res0

    triangleArea(3, 4) shouldBe 6
    triangleArea(5, 6) shouldBe res1
  }

}
