  /**
   * = Higher-Order Functions =
   *
   * Functional languages treat functions as ''first-class values''.
   *
   * This means that, like any other value, a function
   * can be passed as a parameter and returned as a result.
   *
   * This provides a flexible way to compose programs.
   *
   * Functions that take other functions as parameters or that return functions
   * as results are called ''higher order functions''.
   *
   * = Motivation =
   *
   * Consider the following programs.
   *
   * Take the sum of the integers between `a` and `b`:
   *
   * {{{
   *   def sumInts(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
   *     if (a > b) 0 else a + sumInts(a + 1, b)
   * }}}
   *
   * Take the sum of the cubes of all the integers between `a`
   * and `b`:
   *
   * {{{
   *   def cube(x: Int): Int = x * x * x
   *
   *   def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
   *     if (a > b) 0 else cube(a) + sumCubes(a + 1, b)
   * }}}
   *
   * Take the sum of the factorials of all the integers between `a`
   * and `b`:
   *
   * {{{
   *   def sumFactorials(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
   *     if (a > b) 0 else factorial(a) + sumFactorials(a + 1, b)
   * }}}
   *
   * Note how similar these methods are.
   * Can we factor out the common pattern?
   *
   * = Summing with Higher-Order Functions =
   *
   * Let's define:
   *
   * {{{
   *   def sum(f: Int => Int, a: Int, b: Int): Int =
   *     if (a > b) 0
   *     else f(a) + sum(f, a + 1, b)
   * }}}
   *
   * We can then write:
   *
   * {{{
   *   def id(x: Int): Int = x
   *   def sumInts(a: Int, b: Int)       = sum(id, a, b)
   *   def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int)      = sum(cube, a, b)
   *   def sumFactorials(a: Int, b: Int) = sum(factorial, a, b)
   * }}}
   *
   * = Function Types =
   *
   * The type `A => B` is the type of a ''function'' that
   * takes an argument of type `A` and returns a result of
   * type `B`.
   *
   * So, `Int => Int` is the type of functions that map integers to integers.
   *
   * Similarly, `(A1, A2) => B` is the type of functions that take two arguments
   * (of types `A1` and `A2`, respectively) and return a result of type `B`.
   *
   * More generally, `(A1, ..., An) => B` is the type of functions that take `n`
   * arguments (of types `A1` to An`) and return a result of type `B`.
   *
   * = Anonymous Functions =
   *
   * Passing functions as parameters leads to the creation of many small functions.
   *
   * Sometimes it is tedious to have to define (and name) these functions using `def`.
   *
   * Compare to strings: We do not need to define a string using `val`. Instead of:
   *
   * {{{
   *   val str = "abc"; println(str)
   * }}}
   *
   * We can directly write:
   *
   * {{{
   *   println("abc")
   * }}}
   *
   * because strings exist as ''literals''. Analogously we would like function
   * literals, which let us write a function without giving it a name.
   *
   * These are called ''anonymous functions''.
   *
   * == Anonymous Function Syntax ==
   *
   * Example of a function that raises its argument to a cube:
   *
   * {{{
   *   (x: Int) => x * x * x
   * }}}
   *
   * Here, `(x: Int)` is the ''parameter'' of the function, and
   * `x * x * x` is its ''body''.
   *
   * The type of the parameter can be omitted if it can be inferred by the
   * compiler from the context.
   *
   * If there are several parameters, they are separated by commas:
   *
   * {{{
   *   (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y
   * }}}
   *
   * == Anonymous Functions are Syntactic Sugar ==
   *
   * An anonymous function `(x1: T1, …, xn: Tn) => e`
   * can always be expressed using `def` as follows:
   *
   * {{{
   *   { def f(x1: T1, …, xn: Tn) = e ; f }
   * }}}
   *
   * where `f` is an arbitrary, fresh name (that's not yet used in the program).
   *
   * One can therefore say that anonymous functions are ''syntactic sugar''.
   *
   * == Summation with Anonymous Functions ==
   *
   * Using anonymous functions, we can write sums in a shorter way:
   *
   * {{{
   *   def sumInts(a: Int, b: Int)  = sum(x => x, a, b)
   *   def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int) = sum(x => x * x * x, a, b)
   * }}}
   *
   * = Exercise =
   *
   * The `sum` function uses linear recursion. Complete the following tail-recursive
   * version:
   */
  def tailRecSum(res0: Int, res1: Int): Unit = {
    def sum(f: Int => Int, a: Int, b: Int): Int = {
      def loop(x: Int, acc: Int): Int =
        if (x > b) acc
        else loop(x + 1, acc + f(x))
      loop(a, res0)
    }
    sum(x => x, 1, res1) shouldBe 55
  }
}
