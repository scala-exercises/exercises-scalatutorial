  /**
   * = Motivation =
   *
   * Consider the following program that finds the second prime number between 1000 and 10000:
   *
   * {{{
   *   ((1000 to 10000) filter isPrime)(1)
   * }}}
   *
   * This is ''much'' shorter than the recursive alternative:
   *
   * {{{
   *   def secondPrime(from: Int, to: Int) = nthPrime(from, to, 2)
   *   def nthPrime(from: Int, to: Int, n: Int): Int =
   *     if (from >= to) throw new Error("no prime")
   *     else if (isPrime(from))
   *       if (n == 1) from else nthPrime(from + 1, to, n - 1)
   *     else nthPrime(from + 1, to, n)
   * }}}
   *
   * But from a standpoint of performance, the first version is pretty bad; it constructs
   * ''all'' prime numbers between `1000` and `10000` in a list, but only ever looks at
   * the first two elements of that list.
   *
   * Reducing the upper bound would speed things up, but risks that we miss the
   * second prime number all together.
   *
   * = Delayed Evaluation =
   *
   * However, we can make the short-code efficient by using a trick:
   *
   *  - Avoid computing the tail of a sequence until it is needed for the evaluation
   *    result (which might be never)
   *
   * This idea is implemented in a new class, the `Stream`.
   *
   * Streams are similar to lists, but their tail is evaluated only ''on demand''.
   *
   * = Defining Streams =
   *
   * Streams are defined from a constant `Stream.empty` and a constructor `Stream.cons`.
   *
   * For instance,
   *
   * {{{
   *   val xs = Stream.cons(1, Stream.cons(2, Stream.empty))
   * }}}
   *
   * = Stream Ranges =
   *
   * Let's try to write a function that returns a `Stream` representing a range of numbers
   * between `lo` and `hi`:
   *
   * {{{
   *   def streamRange(lo: Int, hi: Int): Stream[Int] =
   *     if (lo >= hi) Stream.empty
   *     else Stream.cons(lo, streamRange(lo + 1, hi))
   * }}}
   *
   * Compare to the same function that produces a list:
   *
   * {{{
   *   def listRange(lo: Int, hi: Int): List[Int] =
   *     if (lo >= hi) Nil
   *     else lo :: listRange(lo + 1, hi)
   * }}}
   *
   * The functions have almost identical structure yet they evaluate quite differently.
   *
   *  - `listRange(start, end)` will produce a list with `end - start` elements and return it.
   *  - `streamRange(start, end)` returns a single object of type `Stream` with `start` as head element.
   *    - The other elements are only computed when they are needed, where
   *      “needed” means that someone calls `tail` on the stream.
   *
   * = Methods on Streams =
   *
   * `Stream` supports almost all methods of `List`.
   *
   * For instance, to find the second prime number between 1000 and 10000:
   *
   * {{{
   *   (streamRange(1000, 10000) filter isPrime)(1)
   * }}}
   *
   * The one major exception is `::`.
   *
   * `x :: xs` always produces a list, never a stream.
   *
   * There is however an alternative operator `#::` which produces a stream.
   *
   * {{{
   *   x #:: xs  ==   Stream.cons(x, xs)
   * }}}
   *
   * `#::` can be used in expressions as well as patterns.
   *
   * = Implementation of Streams =
   *
   * The implementation of streams is quite close to the one of lists.
   *
   * Here's the trait `Stream`:
   *
   * {{{
   *   trait Stream[+T] extends Seq[T] {
   *     def isEmpty: Boolean
   *     def head: T
   *     def tail: Stream[T]
   *     …
   *   }
   * }}}
   *
   * As for lists, all other methods can be defined in terms of these three.
   *
   * Concrete implementations of streams are defined in the `Stream` companion object.
   * Here's a first draft:
   *
   * {{{
   *   object Stream {
   *     def cons[T](hd: T, tl: => Stream[T]) = new Stream[T] {
   *       def isEmpty = false
   *       def head = hd
   *       def tail = tl
   *       override def toString = "Stream(" + hd + ", ?)"
   *     }
   *     val empty = new Stream[Nothing] {
   *       def isEmpty = true
   *       def head = throw new NoSuchElementException("empty.head")
   *       def tail = throw new NoSuchElementException("empty.tail")
   *       override def toString = "Stream()"
   *     }
   *   }
   * }}}
   *
   * The only important difference between the implementations of `List` and `Stream`
   * concern `tl`, the second parameter of `Stream.cons`.
   *
   * For streams, this is a by-name parameter: the type of `tl` starts with `=>`. In such
   * a case, this parameter is evaluated by following the rules of the call-by-name model.
   *
   * That's why the second argument to `Stream.cons` is not evaluated at the point of call.
   *
   * Instead, it will be evaluated each time someone calls `tail` on a `Stream` object.
   *
   * The other stream methods are implemented analogously to their list counterparts.
   *
   * For instance, here's `filter`:
   *
   * {{{
   *   class Stream[+T] {
   *     …
   *     def filter(p: T => Boolean): Stream[T] =
   *       if (isEmpty) this
   *       else if (p(head)) cons(head, tail.filter(p))
   *       else tail.filter(p)
   *   }
   * }}}
   *
   * = Exercise =
   *
   * Consider the following modification of `streamRange`. When you write
   * `streamRange(1, 10).take(3).toList` what is the value of `rec`?
   */
  def streamRangeExercise(res0: Int): Unit = {
    var rec = 0
    def streamRange(lo: Int, hi: Int): Stream[Int] = {
      rec = rec + 1
      if (lo >= hi) Stream.empty
      else Stream.cons(lo, streamRange(lo + 1, hi))
    }
    streamRange(1, 10).take(3).toList
    rec shouldBe res0
  }

  /**
   * = Lazy Evaluation =
   *
   * The proposed `Stream` implementation suffers from a serious potential performance
   * problem: If `tail` is called several times, the corresponding stream
   * will be recomputed each time.
   *
   * This problem can be avoided by storing the result of the first
   * evaluation of `tail` and re-using the stored result instead of recomputing `tail`.
   *
   * This optimization is sound, since in a purely functional language an
   * expression produces the same result each time it is evaluated.
   *
   * We call this scheme ''lazy evaluation'' (as opposed to ''by-name evaluation'' in
   * the case where everything is recomputed, and ''strict evaluation'' for normal
   * parameters and `val` definitions.)
   *
   * == Lazy Evaluation in Scala ==
   *
   * Haskell is a functional programming language that uses lazy evaluation by default.
   *
   * Scala uses strict evaluation by default, but allows lazy evaluation of value definitions
   * with the `lazy val` form:
   *
   * {{{
   *   lazy val x = expr
   * }}}
   *
   * == Exercise ==
