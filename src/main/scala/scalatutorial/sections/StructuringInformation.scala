  /**
   * = Introduction =
   *
   * Programs are systems that process information. Therefore, programming
   * languages provide ways to model the domain of a program.
   *
   * This section introduces the ways you can structure information in Scala.
   * We will base our examples on the following domain, a ''music sheet'':
   *
   * <img src="/assets/scala_tutorial/music_sheet.png" style="max-width: 100%" />
   *
   * = Aggregating Information With Case Classes =
   *
   * First, let’s focus on ''notes''. Suppose that, in our program, we are
   * interested in the following properties of notes: their
   * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_note#12-tone_chromatic_scale name]]
   * (A, B, C, etc.), their
   * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_value duration]] (whole, half,
   * quarter, etc.) and their octave number.
   *
   * In summary, our note model ''aggregates'' several data (name,
   * duration and octave). We express this in Scala by using a ''case class''
   * definition:
   *
   * {{{
   *   case class Note(
   *     name: String,
   *     duration: String,
   *     octave: Int
   *   )
   * }}}
   *
   * This definition introduces a new type, `Note`. You can create values
   * of this type by calling its ''constructor'':
   *
   * {{{
   *   val c3 = Note("C", "Quarter", 3)
   * }}}
   *
   * `c3` is a value that aggregates the arguments passed to the `Note`
   * constructor.
   *
   * Then, you can retrieve the information carried by each ''member'' (`name`,
   * `duration` and `octave`) by using the dot notation:
   */
  def caseClassProjection(res0: String, res1: Int): Unit = {
    case class Note(name: String, duration: String, octave: Int)
    val c3 = Note("C", "Quarter", 3)
    c3.name shouldBe "C"
    c3.duration shouldBe res0
    c3.octave shouldBe res1
  }

  /**
   * = Defining Alternatives With Sealed Traits =
   *
   * If we look at the introductory picture, we see that musical symbols
   * can be either ''notes'' or ''rests'' (but nothing else).
   *
   * So, we want to introduce the concept of ''symbol'', as something
   * that can be embodied by a fixed set of alternatives: a note or rest.
   * We can express this in Scala using a ''sealed trait'' definition:
   *
   * {{{
   *   sealed trait Symbol
   *   case class Note(name: String, duration: String, octave: Int) extends Symbol
   *   case class Rest(duration: String) extends Symbol
   * }}}
   *
   * A sealed trait definition introduces a new type (here, `Symbol`), but no
   * constructor for it. Constructors are defined by alternatives that
   * ''extend'' the sealed trait:
   *
   * {{{
   *   val symbol1: Symbol = Note("C", "Quarter", 3)
   *   val symbol2: Symbol = Rest("Whole")
   * }}}
   *
   * = Pattern Matching =
   *
   * Since the `Symbol` type has no members, we can not do anything
   * useful when we manipulate one. We need a way to distinguish between
   * the different cases of symbols. ''Pattern matching'' allows us
   * to do so:
   *
   * {{{
   *   def symbolDuration(symbol: Symbol): String =
   *     symbol match {
   *       case Note(name, duration, octave) => duration
   *       case Rest(duration) => duration
   *     }
   * }}}
   *
   * The above `match` expression first checks if the given `Symbol` is a
   * `Note`, and if it is the case it extracts its fields (`name`, `duration`
   * and `octave`) and evaluates the expression at the right of the arrow.
   * Otherwise, it checks if the given `Symbol` is a `Rest`, and if it
   * is the case it extracts its `duration` field, and evaluates the
   * expression at the right of the arrow.
   *
   * When we write `case Rest(duration) => …`, we say that `Rest(…)` is a
   * ''constructor pattern'': it matches all the values of type `Rest`
   * that have been constructed with arguments matching the pattern `duration`.
   *
   * The pattern `duration` is called a ''variable pattern''. It matches
   * any value and ''binds'' its name (here, `duration`) to this value.
   *
   * More generally, an expression of the form
   *
   * {{{
   *   e match {
   *     case p1 => e1
   *     case p2 => e2
   *     …
   *     case pn => en
   *   }
   * }}}
   *
   * matches the value of the selector `e` with the patterns
   * `p1`, …, `pn` in the order in which they are written.
   *
   * The whole match expression is rewritten to the right-hand side of the first
   * case where the pattern matches the selector `e`.
   *
   * References to pattern variables are replaced by the corresponding
   * parts in the selector.
   *
   * == Exhaustivity ==
   *
   * Having defined `Symbol` as a sealed trait gives us the guarantee that
   * the possible case of symbols is fixed. The compiler can leverage this
   * knowledge to warn us if we write code that does not handle ''all''
   * the cases:
   * {{{
   * sealed trait Symbol
   * case class Note(name: String, duration: String, octave: Int) extends Symbol
   * case class Rest(duration: String)                            extends Symbol
   *
   * def nonExhaustiveDuration(symbol: Symbol): String =
   *   symbol match {
   *     case Rest(duration) => duration
   *   }
   *
   *}}}
   *
   * If we try to run the above code to see how the compiler informs us that
   * we don’t handle all the cases in `nonExhaustiveDuration`.
   *
   * = Equals =
   *
   * It is worth noting that, since the purpose of case classes is to
   * aggregate values, comparing case class instances compare their values:
   *
   */
  def caseClassEquals(res0: Boolean, res1: Boolean): Unit = {
    case class Note(name: String, duration: String, octave: Int)
    val c3      = Note("C", "Quarter", 3)
    val otherC3 = Note("C", "Quarter", 3)
    val f3      = Note("F", "Quarter", 3)
    (c3 == otherC3) shouldBe res0
    (c3 == f3) shouldBe res1
  }

  /**
   * = Enumerations =
   *
   * Our above definition of the `Note` type allows users to create instances
   * with invalid names and durations:
   *
   * {{{
   *   val invalidNote = Note("not a name", "not a duration", 3)
   * }}}
   *
   * It is generally a bad idea to work with a model that makes it possible
   * to reach invalid states. In our case, we want to restrict the space
   * of the possible note names and durations to a set of fixed alternatives.
   *
   * In the case of note names, the alternatives are either `A`, `B`, `C`,
   * `D`, `E`, `F` or `G`. We can express the fact that note names are
   * a fixed set of alternatives by using a sealed trait, but in contrast to
   * the previous example alternatives are not case classes because they
   * aggregate no information:
   *
   * {{{
   *   sealed trait NoteName
   *   case object A extends NoteName
   *   case object B extends NoteName
   *   case object C extends NoteName
   *   …
   *   case object G extends NoteName
   * }}}
   *
   * = Algebraic Data Types =
   *
   * Data types defined with sealed trait and case classes are called
   * ''algebraic data types''. An algebraic data type definition can
   * be thought of as a set of possible values.
   *
   * Algebraic data types are a powerful way to structure information.
   *
   * If a concept of your program’s domain can be formulated in terms of
   * an ''is'' relationship, you will express it with a sealed trait:
   *
   * “A symbol ''is'' either a note ''or'' a rest.”
   *
   * {{{
   *   sealed trait Symbol
   *   case class Note(…) extends Symbol
   *   case class Rest(…) extends Symbol
   * }}}
   *
   * On the other hand, if a concept of your program’s domain can be
   * formulated in terms of an ''has'' relationship, you will express it
   * with a case class:
   *
   * “A note ''has'' a name, a duration ''and'' an octave number.”
   *
   * {{{
   *   case class Note(name: String, duration: String, octave: Int) extends Symbol
   * }}}
   *
   * = Exercise =
   *
   * Consider the following algebraic data type that models note durations.
   * Complete the implementation of the function `fractionOfWhole`, which
   * takes as parameter a duration and returns the corresponding fraction
   * of the `Whole` duration.

  def adts(res0: Double, res1: Double): Unit = {
    sealed trait Duration
    case object Whole   extends Duration
    case object Half    extends Duration
    case object Quarter extends Duration

    def fractionOfWhole(duration: Duration): Double =
      duration match {
        case Whole   => 1.0
        case Half    => res0
        case Quarter => res1
      }
